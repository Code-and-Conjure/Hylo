The Artist is trying to deal with past trauma by creating a graphic novel documenting his life/struggles. As he reflects on and relives this trauma, he becomes broken, and forms our main player character - Hylo (a shadow version of a homunculus). It is not known at the time but there are more shadows/homunculus formed. Hylo needs to find these shadows and merge with them to repair the Artist (and win the game).

There are three shadows to collect. One is Black, one is White, and one is Yellow, and they need to be found in that order. These are all bosses. It's also not obvious until the very end of the game, but the final boss is called Azoth and he is red; he is a fourth shadow/homunculus that came from the Artist and is needed to become whole again.

Hylo has a weapon, some form of a staff-like object, because we are mimicking the form of a caduceus (just not so obviously). When Hylo beats the bosses, they die. But he then touches them with his staff and they come back to life, then they turn into a stream of liquid-like shadow and wrap around the staff like snakes (maintaining their color). If we use a writing utensil instead of a staff, we would stray more from the form of a caduceus but we could make the color of the ink turn into the shadow Hylo just beat. So first it would turn black, then white (which we could do cool things with if after that fight he has to go to a dark level/scene). Then it would turn yellow, then red.

After Hylo beats Azoth, and gains the red, he finishes the game by finding a vessel to combine the four other shadows/homunculus and himself, which turns Hylo gold, and then he combines with/morphs back into the Artist to heal him and make him whole. Also, when Hylo beats any regular shadow-enemy, he gains a memory from the Artist's life. When he beats the boss shadows, he gets more important/complete memories that progress the story of the Artist's life.

We may also want to have Hylo search for magic/healing spells for himself, or maybe he needs to find pieces of the one spell that will help him combine with the other main shadows/homunculus in the vessel to finish the game.



How our characters/story/objectives tie back to Alchemy:
	- In a religio-philosophical sense, Alchemy is the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form. So Hylo is trying to combine all the elements of the Artist, so transmutate into the divine form of the Artist healed.
	- Alchemical writers often used Greek, Roman and Egyption mythology to allegorize alchemical transmutation. Frequently, Isis and Osiris, and Jason (of the Argonauts) were used.
		- One of the main myths of Isis and Osiris is that after Set killed Osiris, Isis had to find all the pieces of his body to reassemble it and bring him back to life (which is also the basis for mummification). So Hylo is finding all the pieces of the Artist to restore him.
		- Jason had a quest to find the Golden Fleece. The goal of Alchemical transmutation of base metals was to turn them into noble metals, particularly gold, which also was representative of the creation of an elixir of immortality. Jason's Golden Fleece was to help him reclaim his father's throne and make him a king (a metaphorically divine being). 
	- Alkahest was a theorized universal solvent supposed to be capable of dissolving any composite substance without altering or destroying its fundamental components. Perhaps the Artist's ink is analogous to this substance, but dissolving the Artist's memories, and while it scattered his fundamental components in the form of Hylo and the shadows/homunculus, they are still the Artist himself. Maybe we could even have an ink bottle with a company brand of Alkahest or that can be printed on the side of a pencil/crayon/pen. Not super obvious but kind of as an Easter egg.
		- By extracting the fundamental virtues and properties of composite substances, alchemists hoped to gain control of invaluable medical healing properties. Perhaps the virtues/properties that get extracted from the Artist are his memories. Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation (a philosophical form of transmutation) to be personal knowledge. Gnosis was a Greek noun meaning knowledge or awareness, often used for personal knowledge compared with intellectual knowledge. So these memories are integral to the transmutation of Hylo into the divine form of the reassembled shadows/homunculus and the Artist.
	- Our character name of Hylo comes from the concept of Hyle or Hylomorphism. Hyle is a transliteration of Aristotle's concept of matter, the first matter of the cosmos from which the four elements (fire, water, air, earth) arose. Aristotle defines matter as that out of which something is made; an object counts as matter relative to something else. For example, clay is matter relative to a brick because a brick is made of clay, whereas the brick is matter relative to a brick house. Hylo is matter relative to the Artist.
		- Aristotle applies his theory of hylomorphism to living things. He defines a soul as that which makes a living thing alive. So in our case, Hylo is the Artist's soul, and the longer the Artist is without his soul, his physical and mental state deteriorates. The concept of unity between a body and soul is akin to the unity of wax and its shape. Just as a wax object consists of wax within a certain shape, so a living organism consists of a body with the property of life, which is its soul. A running car is running not only because of its structure, but also because of the activity ni its engine. Likewise, a living body is alive not only because of its structure, but also because of the activity of the soul, which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive. 
	- Spagyric, or spagyria, is a method to improve the efficacy of existing medicines by separating them into their primordial elements - the tria prima: sulphur (yellow), mercury (red), and salt (white) - and then again recombining them.
		- The word comes from the ancient Greek "to separate, to draw out" and "to combine, to recombine, to gather."
	- Azoth, our final boss' name, is a universal remedy or potent solvent sought after in the realm of Alchemy, akin to Alkahest. The quest for Azoth was the crux of numerous alchemical endeavors, symbolized by the cadceus. It is the essential agent of transformation in Alchemy.
		- Initially coined to denote an esoteric formula pursued by alchemists, similar to the Philosopher's Stone, the term Azoth later evolved into a poetic expression for the element mercury. Ancient alchemists believed mercury to be the animating spirit hidden in all matter that makes transmutation possible.
		- The myth of Azoth may stem from misinterpreted observations of solvents like mercury, capable of dissolving gold. So our Azoth is dissolving the "gold" of memories, and the memories are represented by the various other shadows. So when Hylo combines with the other shadows he gains memories back, further unveiling the story.
		- In the context of Renaissance magic, Azoth was often associated with the idea of spiritual enlightenment and the purification of the soul. Some mystical traditions regarded Azoth as a metaphor for the internal transformation required to achieve a higher state of consciousness. It was thought to embody the process of turning base human traits into divine virtues, akin to the transformation of base metals into gold.
		- Azoth's connection to mercury and its fluid, trasformative properties, also made it a symbol of adaptability and change. In the Kabbalah, Azoth is also known as "the Endless One."
	- The caduceus is a short staff entwined by two serpents, sometimes surmounted by wings. It provided the basis for the astronomical symbol for planet Mercury. Thus, through its use in astrology, Alchemy and astronomy, it has come to denote the planet Mercury and by extension the eponymous planetary metal.
		- It is said that the caduceus could wake the sleeping and send the awake to sleep. If applied to the dying, it made their death gentle. If applied to the dead, they return to life. So Hylo uses his form of the caduceus to bring back to life the other shadows/homunculus that he beat so he can merge with them in the end. 
	- The Philosopher's Stone is a mythic alchemical substance capable of turning base metals such as mercury into gold or silver (akin to Alkahest). Alchemists additionally believed that it could be used to make an elixir of life, which made possible rejuvination and immortality.
		- Alchemists used the clasical elements, the concept of anima mundi, and Creation stories presented in texts (like Plato's) as analogies for their process. According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia (first matter), associated with chaos. Prima materia is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the Philosopher's Stone.
		- The first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things.
		- An eight-century alchemist analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities.
			- Fire was both hot and dry.
			- Earth was both cold and dry.
			- Water was both cold and moist.
			- Air was both hot and moist.
			- He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, tow of them interior and two exterior, and from that premise reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be effected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. So Hylo is gaining these memories back which reveals the basic qualities of the Artist, and will "rearrange" them (but really combine them) to transmutate the Artist into his full self.
		- The name of God was thought of to be an alchemical vehicle to turn the body into immortal gold. So Hylo learning the story of the Artist (instead of his name), will be an agent to turn him into his ultimate whole self.
		- Any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher's Stone would prolong their life and heal all forms of illness. Other properties of the Philosopher's Stone were the creation of perpetually burning lamps (which we could play with), transmuation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds, reviving of dead plants, and the creation of flexible or malleable glass (often compared with the creation of a clone or homunculus - a small human being). 
			- The concept of homunculus has roots in preformationism as well as earlier folklore and alchemic traditions. The term lends its name to the cortical homunulus, an image of a person with the size of the body parts distorted to represent how much area of the cerebral cortex of the brain is devoted to it.
			- During medieval and early modern times, it was thought that this artificial humanlike being could be created through alchemy. The homunculus first appears by name in alchemical writings attributed to Paracelsus. Hylo and really all the shadows, are homunculus.
			- The fully grown homunculus was greatly skilled in art and could create giants, dwarves, and other marvels, as through art they were born, therefore art is embodied and inborn in them.
			- Comparisons have been made with several similar concepts in the writings of earlier alchemists. Jung believed that the concept of homunculus first appeared in the Visions of Zosimos. In the visions, Zosimos encounters a priest who changes into the opposite of himself, into a mutilated anthroparion (a creature having human characteristics or traits). Zosimos subsequently encounters other anthroparia (homunculus) in his dream.
			- Jung equated the homunculus with the Philosopher's Stone. The alchemical idea that the soul is not imprisoned in the body, but instead may find its brightest state as it passes through the material plane (our levels).
		- Some suggest that the Philosopher's Stone descriptors are metaphorical. "Make a man and woman a circle, then a quadrangle, out fo this a triangle, make again a circle and you will have the stone of the wise. Thus is made the stone, which thou canst not discover unless you, through diligence, learn to understand this geometrical teaching." In like manner, the quadrangle is reduced into a triangle (body, spirit and soul), which appear in three previous colors before redness - the body or earth in the blackness of Saturn, the spirit in a lunar whiteness (as water), the soul or air in a solar yellow. Then the triangle will be perfect, but then must be changed into a circle, into redness, by which operation the woman is converted into the man and made one with him, having returned again to a unit, in which is eternal rest and peace.
		- Esoteric hermetic alchemists sometimes reject work on exoteric substances, instead directing their search for the Philosopher's Stone inward. It is clear that some alchemists were not concerned with material substances, but were employing the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressing theological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations. The transmutation mediated by the stone has also been interpreted as a psychological process.
		- The book The Sufis provides an analysis of the symbolic significance of the alchemical work with the Philosopher's Stone. The analysis is based in part on a linguistic interpretation through Arabic equivalents of one of the terms for the stone (Azoth) as well as for sulfur, salt and mercury.
		- The stone is created by the alchemical method known as the magnum opus, often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes; in colors it goes through phases of black, white, yellow and red. That's why this is the order and color of our bosses.
